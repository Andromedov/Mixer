**Mixer** is a plugin for Paper servers that enhances the [Simple Voice Chat](https://modrinth.com/plugin/simple-voice-chat) mod. It allows you to create custom music discs that can play audio from any source (like YouTube, SoundCloud, or Direct Link) through the in-game voice chat.

This plugin transforms standard Jukeboxes into a complete audio system, supporting playlists, remote speakers, and audio DSP effects.
